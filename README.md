This is my repository for the SCC.110 project "Air Hockey" (Project 2 in the Summer 2023 Coursework (First Year):

I believe that i have met all requirements of the program and have re-read the functionality requirements as a guideline, meeting all requirements in my code.
I have found, though, that the following hotkeys can be tempremental and may require a few key presses, probably resultant of my Thread.sleep(1) methods and busy program multiple threads.

M - Mute/Unmute sound
Z - Player hitting power boost (Player 1)
X - Player hitting power boost (Player 2)
V - Player 1 gets double points (if no player currently has double points already)
B - Player 2 gets double points (if no player currently has double points already)

I have also found some last minute issues when completing final tests where the double points cheats fail to have an effect, however the player 'power boost' cheats work as expected.
